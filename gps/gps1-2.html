            <h4>What is paired programming?</h4>
                <p>Pair programming has gained in popularity among companies as enabling developers to learn quickly and make fewer mistakes, but it's not as easy as it may seem. Pair programming can enable both partners to learn and grow if communication is open, friendly, and based on mutual trust and respect.</p>

        <article id="why-pair">
            <h4>Why paired programming?</h4>
                <p>There are so many reasons, but I’ll discuss the top three:</p>
                <p><b><em>Learn faster:</em></b>  How would you like to learn Java from James Gosling or C# from Anders Hejlsberg? Pairing is the best way to learn a new platform (wait, you didn’t think it was lecture-style did you?). By placing you at the same keyboard and monitor as the Java wizard who sits in the corner, both driver and navigator benefit. The navigator (also well-versed in software engineering, just not Java) brings the same benefits to the driver as a second set of eyes, constantly probing and questioning, “why are things are done that way?” Inevitably the old rules and ineffective habits of the driver are broken.  The navigator learns Java faster than they could in the classroom, faster than books and faster than on their own.</p>
                <p><b><em>Transfer domain knowledge:</em></b> The old adage used to be that engineers should focus on one area of specialty and it was rare to find engineers who were good at more than one thing (i.e. like an engineer who was great at both JavaScript and back-end database optimization).  Pairing dispels this old paradigm.  Pair a front-end engineer (Anisha) with a back-end engineer (Brian) for a few months and you’ll see Anisha cranking out prepared statements and Brian working on HTML5 optimizations in no time. Don’t believe me? Come and pair on a project in a system you’ve never worked on before.</p>
                <p><b><em>Intensity:</em></b> It’s so hard to concentrate these days. With Twitter/Facebook/email/YouTube/Tumblr/IM/etc, I’m not sure how any work gets done. What if I could put a super-sharp engineer beside you to help you focus on the tasks at hand? Now what if the two of you could bounce ideas off each other and unblock each other faster than looking up answers on Google? No, those services aren’t blocked, it’s just with two people working together the urge to check personalized services (including email) usually waits until a creative break. i.e. more time on task.</p>

        <article id="driver-compairson">
            <h4>A short comparison between Driver & Navigator roles</h4>
                <p>A sucessful pair programming session is heavlily dependent on the sucess of the team's roles as driver and naviagtor. </p>
                <p>The driver is the programmer with his or her hands on the keyboard, listening for directions from the navigator. This distinction is important because it eliminates the confusion and mess of both programmers typing at once. This allows for collaboration and a flow of ideas between the pair and an effiecnt way to keep the work process effiecnt. By only having the driver type, the navigator is freed up to search for erros within the code, research topics, and view rescoures like wireframes, etc. The open dialouge between driver and navigator makes the pair programming process smooth and easy. To make sure both programmers are expirencing both roles, switiching between driver and navigator is encouraged and expected.</p>

  <!-- Add your reflection here. -->
Overall, I feel like this gps really helped solidfy the ideas of positioning and sytling in css. It was wierd to have to collaborate on css with another person for the first time because our ideas about formating and other things would contras and we would have to figure out a way to best represent both of our ideas. I think that working on websites as a pair or more is a good strategy because having two minds working and thinking makes the process quicker and easier as people can focus on different tasks and the team can combine their strengths and minimize their weaknesses.
