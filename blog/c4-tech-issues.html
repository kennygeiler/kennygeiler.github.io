      One of the biggest problems facing the tech world today has nothing to do with technology itself. How is that possible one may ask? Well, it turns out, a major problem with the tech world is its culture. It is no secret that the tech world is domianted by males. There are countless tales of women being outnumbed and uncomfortable in the workplace. Women report feeling discrimination based on their age, race, sexuality, and the prospects of motherhood. In a fortune.com article surverying 716 women in the tech industry who have left the tech industry who have left mainly because they have no desire to work in the industry. Is it because its too hard? No. The major reason is the workplace environment was so bad that 465 of the women survery ended up not working at all, 251 are working in a non-tech job, and 45 of them are now running their own companies. One may think there are a lack of women in tech, which can cause them to be outnumbered. Incorrect. Top computer science colleges like Stanford accept apx. 50% males and females. The only way to fix this problem is to fix the entire culture of the tech industry workplace, and destory the out-dated views of male dominance in the workplace.
