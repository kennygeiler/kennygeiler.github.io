    <p>
      When I have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, a few values come to mind: community, couage, and creativity. I try to live by these values strongly. I am always in touch with my community, I volunteer and help as much as I can in my local town and schools. I always try to be courageous with my actions and not let my peers or popular opinions shape how I act or think. And, creativity, is one of the most important values in life because expressing ones creativity allows for them to expirence life fully and more beautifully. Creativity is important because each person's view on one thing can differ so widely and the things that humans can do from their creativity has been showcased time and time again with amazing inventions and art. I would always promote this mindset in hopes of continuing creative thinking and progress in terms of technology, art, writing, etc. I was asked advice last on the values of leadership. Being close to a political familiy, I see a lot of the behind the scene of local politics. My values are in tune with understanding stereotype threat in terms of I would use my values to make sure that people don't feel that way.
