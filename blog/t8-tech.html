    <p>
      Recursion is a complex topic, that can be broken into more simple ideas that are better for understanding. Recursion is best used when a larger task can be broken down into smaller tasks and have a repetitive routine that calls itself to to preform the smaller tasks. But first, there is a base case that is not repeated. Therefore writing a recursive method requires a base case and then a repetitive loop that can continuesly run to complete the task.
