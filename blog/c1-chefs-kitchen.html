      So far, about five days into my DBC expirence, I am satisfied with the amount that I have learnd and excited for things in the coming weeks. Although this week's challenges have not been too challenging, I still feel like a lot was learned, espescially in naviagating through the command line. The culture of DBC seems forgien to me still as it is wierd to be going through the same challenges and lessons as people across the country without ever seeing them in person (until the on-site that is). I can already see that the people in my cohort are kind and dedicated and I am looking forward to becoming closer with them as we all take the journey to be better programmers. My expections are pretty broad at this point because I do not know how I will fair as the challegnes get tougher but as of now I am grasping the material and feel confident for the future. I have to admit I am slightly nervous about the group pairing sessions as I do not want to hold anyone down or be the student who is considered worse at coding. Hopefully, this fear will be abolished in the coming week, but only time will tell.
