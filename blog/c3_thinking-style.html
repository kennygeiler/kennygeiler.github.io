    <p>
        Re-reading the list of thinking styles, I find myself wanting to pick and chose from the different types rather than just stick with one. I strongly agree with the styles of the abstract random but I also see myself under concrete random becuase of my willingess to take risks and use my intuition. I can help learn more at DBC by being able to identify how my brain works best and what working environments I am most comfortbale in. Knowing that I like broad guidlines and independent space to work in will help me make the most of my time in the program. Also, knowing that I work well with friends will help me want to get to know my peers better and to create a friendship with them. So far at DBC, my biggest struggle has just been grasping my mind around ruby. It is such a vast language and I am now realizing how much I will have to learn in order to fully use its power. I am scared, but am willing to take on the challenge. I know that the growth mindset will be needed here because every day I have to adjust my thought process and accept that its okay to not know a lot of things because it is new to me and I should put being the best aside and just want to learn the most possible.
