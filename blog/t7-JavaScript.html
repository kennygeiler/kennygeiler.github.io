    <p>
      What are javascript objects? Well, in javascript you create an object and manipulate it by writing properties to it like name, age, etc. This holds data like a hash holds data in Ruby. The major difference is that a javascript object is a collection of properties that references other objects, but a ruby object holds a hash of variables that reference other objects. You can only access elements of a hash by calling it through the hash itself.
