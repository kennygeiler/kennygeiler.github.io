    <p>
      Variable scope is an important concept in ruby and programming as a whole. Classes, methods, and more depend on the inputs and modifications of variables. These variables have to be properly created and scoped so that they can be accessed at the right place and not accidently altered in the wrong ones. The variable scope catagories are: global, instance, local, constant, and class variable. A local variable is one that is created in a method or a loop and can only be accessed within that method / loop. On the other hand, a global variable is accessible from anywhere in the program regardless of where they are declared. These variables have a $ sign in front of them. A class variable is one that is shared for all objects instantiated within a class. Instance variables can be changed within a class but do not work outside the class. A constant variable is one who's value should not be changed and says "constant" throughout the code.
