    <p>Currently a Sophomore studying computer science at Washington University in St. Louis, I decided to take a semester off to attend Dev Bootcamp in New York City. I came to this decision because I grew tired of learning only about the theorectical aspect of computer science and wanted to be able to build something real. I decided that the best way to combine my desire for understanding algorithims and creating real applications through web developement was to attend a programming bootcamp. I am currently halfway through Dev Bootcamp program, which is an 19 week program that teachs ruby on rails, javascript, html, css, sql, and various web frameworks. I am excited to complete the program, work this summer, and finally be able to combine my strong theorectical knowledge of computer science with the full stack developement skills I am learning at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
