    <p>Thank you for checking out my blog. Here you will find my thoughts and feelings about my expirences at DBC. I hope these posts can help you understand what its like to be a part of this community and learn some basic concepts of being a developer!</p>

    <h4 class="blogsubtitle">Week 1 Recap</h4>
    <h4 class="tldr">All about version control & Git/Github</h4>
    <h4 class="blogdate">Friday the 16th, 2015</h4>
    <p>Version control is an extremely useful tool for developers. Using version control allows developers to venture and make changes to code without worrying about altering previous code. In addition, version control saves all edits so if mistakes are made, developers can go back to previous versions of the code. Git, which is a version control system, helps keep track of these changes. Whenever a change is made to code or a file, it is logged in git and the user can check all of the previous changes through git. Paired with git is GitHub. While git stores all of your versions locally on your computer, GitHub stores them online for you to share with your peers. This is essential for teams that work on the same code and need to view eachother's work seamlessly and easily.</p>

    <h4 class="blogsubtitle">Week 1 Expirences</h4>
    <h4 class="tldr">Thoughts & Feelings about first week at Dev Bootcamp</h4>
    <h4 class="blogdate">Friday the 16th, 2015</h4>
    <p>So far, about five days into my DBC expirence, I am satisfied with the amount that I have learnd and excited for things in the coming weeks. Although this week's challenges have not been too challenging, I still feel like a lot was learned, espescially in naviagating through the command line. The culture of DBC seems forgien to me still as it is wierd to be going through the same challenges and lessons as people across the country without ever seeing them in person (until the on-site that is). I can already see that the people in my cohort are kind and dedicated and I am looking forward to becoming closer with them as we all take the journey to be better programmers. My expections are pretty broad at this point because I do not know how I will fair as the challegnes get tougher but as of now I am grasping the material and feel confident for the future. I have to admit I am slightly nervous about the group pairing sessions as I do not want to hold anyone down or be the student who is considered worse at coding. Hopefully, this fear will be abolished in the coming week, but only time will tell.</p>

    <h3 class="blogtitle">Arrays & Hashes</h3>
  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">All about arrays and hashes</h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">The comparing and contrasting of the different aspects of arrays and hashes</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Friday, January 30th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
        In Ruby, arrays and hashes are very useful tools for working with lists of stored information. Arrays and hashes can hold different types of objects ranging from strings to integers to floats. An array is an ordered list, whose position can be asseced through integers. A hash is more of a collection of key/value pairs. Hashes point objects to other objects giving them meaning while arrays are an ordered list of objects. Therefore, it is easier to access elements of an array, but the use of hashes results in more flexibility.

  <h3 class="blogtitle">Cultural Blog Post #3</h3>
  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">Thinking Style</h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">Thoughts on DBC thus far and what my thinking style is</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Friday, January 30th, 2015</h4>


    <p>
        Re-reading the list of thinking styles, I find myself wanting to pick and chose from the different types rather than just stick with one. I strongly agree with the styles of the abstract random but I also see myself under concrete random becuase of my willingess to take risks and use my intuition. I can help learn more at DBC by being able to identify how my brain works best and what working environments I am most comfortbale in. Knowing that I like broad guidlines and independent space to work in will help me make the most of my time in the program. Also, knowing that I work well with friends will help me want to get to know my peers better and to create a friendship with them. So far at DBC, my biggest struggle has just been grasping my mind around ruby. It is such a vast language and I am now realizing how much I will have to learn in order to fully use its power. I am scared, but am willing to take on the challenge. I know that the growth mindset will be needed here because every day I have to adjust my thought process and accept that its okay to not know a lot of things because it is new to me and I should put being the best aside and just want to learn the most possible.
