    <p>
    I am Kenneth Geiler and am currently a sophomore studying computer science at Washington University in St. Louis, I decided to take a semester off to attend Dev Bootcamp in New York City. I came to this decision because I wanted to build on my knowledge about programming with real applications. Dev Bootcamp was the best way to combine my desire for understanding algorithms and creating web applications. I am currently halfway through Dev Bootcamp program, which is a 19 week 70 hours per week course that teaches ruby on rails, javascript, html, css, sql, and various web frameworks. Most importantly, it teaches new developers, like myself, to be able to learn a new language or concept quickly and concretely. Although, I will graduate with a full stack focusing on Rails, I have the ability to pick up new languages or frameworks in a few days time. I look forward to growing as a programmer and creating projects of my own. </p>
