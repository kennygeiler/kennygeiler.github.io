    <h4 class="blogsubtitle">Week 1 Recap</h4>
    <h4 class="tldr">All about version control & Git/Github</h4>
    <h4 class="blogdate">Friday the 16th, 2015</h4>
    <p>Version control is an extremely useful tool for developers. Using version control allows developers to venture and make changes to code without worrying about altering previous code. In addition, version control saves all edits so if mistakes are made, developers can go back to previous versions of the code. Git, which is a version control system, helps keep track of these changes. Whenever a change is made to code or a file, it is logged in git and the user can check all of the previous changes through git. Paired with git is GitHub. While git stores all of your versions locally on your computer, GitHub stores them online for you to share with your peers. This is essential for teams that work on the same code and need to view eachother's work seamlessly and easily.</p>

    <h4 class="blogsubtitle">Week 1 Expirences</h4>
    <h4 class="tldr">Thoughts & Feelings about first week at Dev Bootcamp</h4>
    <h4 class="blogdate">Friday the 16th, 2015</h4>
    <p>So far, about five days into my DBC expirence, I am satisfied with the amount that I have learnd and excited for things in the coming weeks. Although this week's challenges have not been too challenging, I still feel like a lot was learned, espescially in naviagating through the command line. The culture of DBC seems forgien to me still as it is wierd to be going through the same challenges and lessons as people across the country without ever seeing them in person (until the on-site that is). I can already see that the people in my cohort are kind and dedicated and I am looking forward to becoming closer with them as we all take the journey to be better programmers. My expections are pretty broad at this point because I do not know how I will fair as the challegnes get tougher but as of now I am grasping the material and feel confident for the future. I have to admit I am slightly nervous about the group pairing sessions as I do not want to hold anyone down or be the student who is considered worse at coding. Hopefully, this fear will be abolished in the coming week, but only time will tell.</p>

    <h3 class="blogtitle">Arrays & Hashes</h3>
  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">All about arrays and hashes</h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">The comparing and contrasting of the different aspects of arrays and hashes</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Friday, January 30th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
        In Ruby, arrays and hashes are very useful tools for working with lists of stored information. Arrays and hashes can hold different types of objects ranging from strings to integers to floats. An array is an ordered list, whose position can be asseced through integers. A hash is more of a collection of key/value pairs. Hashes point objects to other objects giving them meaning while arrays are an ordered list of objects. Therefore, it is easier to access elements of an array, but the use of hashes results in more flexibility.

  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">Thinking Style</h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">Thoughts on DBC thus far and what my thinking style is</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Friday, January 30th, 2015</h4>


    <p>
        Re-reading the list of thinking styles, I find myself wanting to pick and chose from the different types rather than just stick with one. I strongly agree with the styles of the abstract random but I also see myself under concrete random becuase of my willingess to take risks and use my intuition. I can help learn more at DBC by being able to identify how my brain works best and what working environments I am most comfortbale in. Knowing that I like broad guidlines and independent space to work in will help me make the most of my time in the program. Also, knowing that I work well with friends will help me want to get to know my peers better and to create a friendship with them. So far at DBC, my biggest struggle has just been grasping my mind around ruby. It is such a vast language and I am now realizing how much I will have to learn in order to fully use its power. I am scared, but am willing to take on the challenge. I know that the growth mindset will be needed here because every day I have to adjust my thought process and accept that its okay to not know a lot of things because it is new to me and I should put being the best aside and just want to learn the most possible.

  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">Researching Ruby methods</h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">All about the cycle method!</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Sunday, Feburary 8th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
        The Ruby method that I will be researching today is #cycle. After reading the Ruby Docs on this method, it seems that is it a powerful method that could be used in place of a while loop. Calling cycle on an array will infinitely print out the elements of the array. Also, if you definete a parameter for the method like .cycle(2), the result will be the array printed out twice. This can be very useful for different situations involving while loops. Cycle can even take advantage of the break command that stops an infinite loop at a certain point. An example of this is:
      <br>
        days_of_week.cycle {|day| puts day}
        <br>
        => Monday
        <br>
        Tuesday

  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">Exploring Problems in the Tech Industry </h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">Women in the Tech industry</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Sunday, Feburary 8th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
 One of the biggest problems facing the tech world today has nothing to do with technology itself. How is that possible one may ask? Well, it turns out, a major problem with the tech world is its culture. It is no secret that the tech world is domianted by males. There are countless tales of women being outnumbed and uncomfortable in the workplace. Women report feeling discrimination based on their age, race, sexuality, and the prospects of motherhood. In a fortune.com article surverying 716 women in the tech industry who have left the tech industry who have left mainly because they have no desire to work in the industry. Is it because its too hard? No. The major reason is the workplace environment was so bad that 465 of the women survery ended up not working at all, 251 are working in a non-tech job, and 45 of them are now running their own companies. One may think there are a lack of women in tech, which can cause them to be outnumbered. Incorrect. Top computer science colleges like Stanford accept apx. 50% males and females. The only way to fix this problem is to fix the entire culture of the tech industry workplace, and destory the out-dated views of male dominance in the workplace.

  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">All about classes</h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">Classes, instance variables, methods, and more!</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Sunday, Febuary 15th</h4>

    <p>
      Classes are the best. When you need to create something that can serve a purpose for different inputs at different times without re-writing methods every time, a class is the ideal solution. When you create a class you are creating a block of code that holds methods and variabls that can be called on different inputs over and over. For example, a class I recently created tested the valididity of a credit card number. Therefore, any time I am given a number, I can create a instance of that class and call the methods I wrote to test that given number. The best part about classes is the ability to carry variables through different methods and modify them. These are called instance variables. They are defined once at the top of a class and you can call them throughout in any method and modify them along the way. You make make your life even eaier with attributes that allow varaibles to be written and called througout a class without having to create a method for them.

  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">Pairing & Feedback</h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">All about how its like to pair and write/recieve feedback</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Sunday, Febuary 15th</h4>


    <p>
      Pairing is a new thing for me. With the little expirence coding I had before DBC, none of it involved pairing. At first, it was slightly awkward to have to share your ideas and work with someone else live in real time without having time to think it through. I have grown to enjoy pairing because it lets me see other people's thought process and how they go about coding and solving challenges. Now, when I pair and complete a challenge I feel proud that my pair and I were able to tackle a tough challenge. Sometimes, it is frusturating to pair because you have to work with conflicting ideas and it makes things harder. One great thing about pairing is that you recieve feedback from your peers which helps you understand what you are doing well and what you could be working on better. Sometimes, you don't even realize what you may be doing wrong or not as good as you could be and the feedback really helps with that. Writing feedback is a litte tricky because you want to be honest but never hurtful.

  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">All about variable scope</h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">The different types of variables and how/why that affects your code</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Sunday, Febuary 22nd</h4>


    <p>
      Variable scope is an important concept in ruby and programming as a whole. Classes, methods, and more depend on the inputs and modifications of variables. These variables have to be properly created and scoped so that they can be accessed at the right place and not accidently altered in the wrong ones. The variable scope catagories are: global, instance, local, constant, and class variable. A local variable is one that is created in a method or a loop and can only be accessed within that method / loop. On the other hand, a global variable is accessible from anywhere in the program regardless of where they are declared. These variables have a $ sign in front of them. A class variable is one that is shared for all objects instantiated within a class. Instance variables can be changed within a class but do not work outside the class. A constant variable is one who's value should not be changed and says "constant" throughout the code.

  <h4 class="blogsubtitle">The Stereotype Threat</h4>
  <h4 class="tldr">Ways to address and change the threats of stereotypes</h4>
  <h4 class="blogdate">Sunday, Febuary 22nd</h4>

    <p>
      Stereotype threat is the feeling of perpetuating negative stereotypes about your race or social group. I have not felt this personally and cannot directly identify with this. However, I have friends of mine who have expirenced this before.I can imagine it is a very scary feeling to think that you are becoming what a stereotye says you are. You always tell yourself that its just a generalization and not you but when you see yourself possibly going down the path of the stereotype you may think its supposed to be true and give in to it. I don't know how I could directly help with this but in general stereotypes are perpetuated by people who believe they are true. If individuals rid these stereotypes from their mind then, slowly, they will cease to exist.
