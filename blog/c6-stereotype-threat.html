    <p>
      Stereotype threat is the feeling of perpetuating negative stereotypes about your race or social group. I have not felt this personally and cannot directly identify with this. However, I have friends of mine who have expirenced this before.I can imagine it is a very scary feeling to think that you are becoming what a stereotye says you are. You always tell yourself that its just a generalization and not you but when you see yourself possibly going down the path of the stereotype you may think its supposed to be true and give in to it. I don't know how I could directly help with this but in general stereotypes are perpetuated by people who believe they are true. If individuals rid these stereotypes from their mind then, slowly, they will cease to exist.
