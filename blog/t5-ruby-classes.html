    <p>
      Classes are the best. When you need to create something that can serve a purpose for different inputs at different times without re-writing methods every time, a class is the ideal solution. When you create a class you are creating a block of code that holds methods and variabls that can be called on different inputs over and over. For example, a class I recently created tested the valididity of a credit card number. Therefore, any time I am given a number, I can create a instance of that class and call the methods I wrote to test that given number. The best part about classes is the ability to carry variables through different methods and modify them. These are called instance variables. They are defined once at the top of a class and you can call them throughout in any method and modify them along the way. You make make your life even eaier with attributes that allow varaibles to be written and called througout a class without having to create a method for them.
