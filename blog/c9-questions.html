    <p>
        I think the biggest problem about asking question over an online medium like the google plus community or websites like stack overflow is that sometimes you do not even know how to articulate your problem because you are so lost and end up writing a question that does not point you to the answer that you were looking for. Once, I had trouble figuring out why a loop in my program was not working and I asked about it on the google community. I did not phrase my question very well and made it too broad instead of focusing on the specifc error of my code and I recieved help that did not actually help me solve my problem. If the question is not specific enough, other people trying to help you will not know the best way to answer you.
