    <p>
      The last conflict I can remember that had an impact on my family was the purchasing of my current car. I wanted to get a stick shift car to go to the track but my family did not think it made sense to buy a car that only I could drive. We fought over the reasons why it did and didn't make sense to buy the car. Ultimately, we decided to get the car for two years. At first I was angry that my parents did not understand why I wanted the car and why it made sense to get it. Then, I felt guilty that I made them buy a car that did not make sense for our family. In the end, I decided to sell the car and get something more practical to help the family.
