      Version control is an extremely useful tool for developers. Using version control allows developers to venture and make changes to code without worrying about altering previous code. In addition, version control saves all edits so if mistakes are made, developers can go back to previous versions of the code. Git, which is a version control system, helps keep track of these changes. Whenever a change is made to code or a file, it is logged in git and the user can check all of the previous changes through git. Paired with git is GitHub. While git stores all of your versions locally on your computer, GitHub stores them online for you to share with your peers. This is essential for teams that work on the same code and need to view eachother's work seamlessly and easily.
