      Pairing is a new thing for me. With the little expirence coding I had before DBC, none of it involved pairing. At first, it was slightly awkward to have to share your ideas and work with someone else live in real time without having time to think it through. I have grown to enjoy pairing because it lets me see other people's thought process and how they go about coding and solving challenges. Now, when I pair and complete a challenge I feel proud that my pair and I were able to tackle a tough challenge. Sometimes, it is frusturating to pair because you have to work with conflicting ideas and it makes things harder. One great thing about pairing is that you recieve feedback from your peers which helps you understand what you are doing well and what you could be working on better. Sometimes, you don't even realize what you may be doing wrong or not as good as you could be and the feedback really helps with that. Writing feedback is a litte tricky because you want to be honest but never hurtful.
