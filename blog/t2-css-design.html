      What's the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? Well these three formating tags each has its own funciton and use when styling with CSS. Imagine a box. At the center of the box is your content, surrounding that box is a border, and that border is within the space of your website. The padding controls the space between the border and your content. The margin controls the space between the border and the walls of the website. So if you wanted to move your content around the page you would use margin, if you wanted to move your content towards or away from your border you would use padding, and if you wanted to change the thinkness, color, style of your border you would use border.
